How to do this lab:
- Create a c++ file executable that takes in the contents:
	. -n FILENUM
	. -a OFFSET
	. -s SCALE_FACTOR
	. -h (help)
	. -d DATA_DIR // The path to the data that we will use

- One of the tricky parts is that -h can appear anywhere and we will have to ignore all the other tokens and print the help message

How it works:
reads the file data and adds the data to a row, and scales the data to a different row.

Need to output all the errors within this program to stderr (cerr stream)
REMINDER: There are 3 posix (unix) std streams. 0 stdin, 1 stdout, 2 stderr

ERROR IN THE LAB WRITEUP: in 5.3. the offset_data_NN.txt should be scaled_data_NN.txt
