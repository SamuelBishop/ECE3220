SPI BUS LAB:

- The accessory board that we have has a MCP3004 Analog-to-Digital Converter chip on it
   . This ADC has four channels (0-3)
   . ch1 goes to potentiometer (wiper) and does a voltage divider that will change the input

- SPI (Serial Pheripheral Interface) bus for the ADC is on top and connects to the 
    . Clock tick (information goes both directions per clock tick FULL DUPLEX)
    . Full Duplex (Both lines can communicate at the same time)
    . Half Duplex (Only one bit of data sent in a single direction per clock tick)

- The chip we are using in the four input version of the ADC chip

WHAT THE ADC DOES: (Voltage in voltage ranges discrete write a number)
    - Voltage from 0-2.5V digital writes a 0
    - Voltage from 2.5-5V digital writes a 1

    CAN BE MODIFIED FOR 2^10 - 1 POSSIBLE VALUES FOR ANALOG:
    - Example: 5/1023 range span segments.

HOW IT WORKS:
    - The multiplexer takes a channel input
    - The channel input is decoded by the multiplexer and is given to the Sample and Hold channel
        . Sample and hold is a series of switches that choose when the dischared voltage is accepted??
        . Uses a mostfet to charge and discharge a capacitor
        . After the mostfet the charge from the capacitor sits there, and the digital -Analog converter will cycle through
            all the possible inputs until it finds the range that correlates to the capacitor voltage.
        . MISO vs MOSI (Master in slave out vs master our slave in) How to know which signals are wanted???
        . Power supply is super noisy and want to have a super stable voltage reference, need an external power supply for this.
    - The SPI bus is supported by both the microcontroller and the ADC.
    - SPI BUS is just a communication protocol, there are many. However SPI BUS and i^2c are the two most common. (MOST/ALL ICS have
        have a communication protocol.
    - 

Daisy Chaining:
    - The spi bus supports daisy chainning which is where the ADC is MISO is connected to another MOSI on a different ADC, this can
        be compacted for as many ADCs as you want. Creates a giant bit shifting system with ADC clock delay speed.
    - All of the clock speeds must be the same.
    - Saves pins on the microcontroller.

RPI Notes:
    - ls /dev shows you all of the different hardware devices on the rpi
        . We will be working with spidev0 (spidev0.0 is chip enable 0 and spidev0.1 is chip enable 1)

Endian-ness:
    - Little endian means that the least significant byte is stored at the address of the location.
    - Big endian means that the most significant byte is stored at the address of the location.

    - The ADC is set up for big endian...
    - The rpi linux os is set up for big endian...
        THIS SUCKS. But there are built in functions to perform byte swapping! This is such a common problem. The grad student
        who mad the accessory board probably didnt even have to do that much additional work.

Useful information:
    - 2^10 = 1KB
    - 2^20 = 1MB
    - 2^30 = 1GB
    - 2^40 = 1TB

    - Wrap into a tarball by:
        tar cz -f 04-adc-sjbc35.tar.gz 04-adc

HIGH-Z STATE:
    - Something about pull down or pull up??
    - On RPI the value is pulled down to logic low through voltage divider. Ticks are always pulled down to low unless there is a driver behind it.

HOW DOES CLOCK COMMUNICATION WORK OVER SPI?:
    - Start bit is the bit before the communcation is opened. Will always be 1 when open communication.

    - First clock tick is SGL/DIFF (single ended mesaurment mode (channel in and ground difference) or 
        differential mode (two different sample channels). Can simulat a differential input with two single ended inputs.
    - D0 (Channel 1 input on?)
    - D1 (Channel 2 input on?)
    - D2 (Channel 3 input on?)
    - D3 (Channel 4 input on?)
    - NULL Bit
    - B9-B0 (Ten bit conversion value)
    - Excess data (4byte remainder usually filled with 0s)

UNION type in C and C++:
    - No type assosicated with union makes it an anonymous union.
    - Can interperit a chunk of memory as multiple different types. Example in rpi-accessory.cc.
    - Can byte swap to the big endian format EX __builtin_bswap32(0x00019000).

WHAT TO DO BECAUSE YOU DONT HAVE YOUR SD CARD:
1) mount.rpifs
2) decompress the tarball of the rpi w/
    tar xf ~/Downloads/04-adc.tar.gz -C PIFOLDER
                                      ^ Change dir
