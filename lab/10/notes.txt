Lab 10 Notes

CONCURRENCY CONTROL->
How do we prevent threads from grabbing the same variable and altering the memory
at the same time?:

CPU Format:
- Multiple cores
- In each core we have multiple threads and multiple caches
- The threads manipulte the cache that manipulate the RAM
	. The act of clearing the cache into RAM is called flushing

Critical Section: A section of code where we have to take extra precautions that
data we are reading and writing are up to date (shared resources).

Atomic Operations: A process that cannot be interrupted until a core finishes its read,
modify, and write functions.

MUTEX (MUTual EXclusion object): Like a key. Controlled access to a resource.
Used to ensure atomisity in critical section.
- Should not be used inside of an inturrupt

Circuitry of the Accessory Board:
- Bottom of the circuit w/ logic gates performs a task called debouncing. To left.
- Switches will turn on/off/on etc when toggled until settled. Processor reads them fast.
	. To fix you could put a capacitor down that charges up immediately and discharges
	slowly. Never discharges far enough to get off of logic high.
	. Software debouncing can be done but it will always take longer than hardware
	debouncing.
- Logic chips are inverter & _____
	. Weird gate is called a schmidt trigger. It is necessary because voltage of signal
	follows the noise of the voltage input, and and ordinary gate might glitch 3/4
	times before the final state transition.
	  The schmidt trigger has two thresholds and needs to pass both thresholds in order
	to be considered a logic high.
	
IMPLEMENTING AN INTURRUPT SERVICE ROUTINE:
- In the wiringPi page on the internet the inturrupt section is listed under:
	Program, timing, and threads
- The function that prompts an inturrupt service routine is called:
	wiringPiSR(int pin, int edgeType, void (*function)(void));	
	. This is telling the wiringPi library the function for the pin event we want to watch-
