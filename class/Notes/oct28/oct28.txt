TAKEAWAYS:
- To run preprocessor "cpp -P main.cc"
    . This will pretty much just show you all of the code smooshed together
- Declarations can be repeated within the same translation unit



Terms I should be familiar with:
- Definition (the thing) vs declaration (telling the complier about the thing)
    . Class definition requires some storage. Template definition does not do anything without an obj declared in code.
- Include Guard
    . Aka header guard, header include guard

    Used to create non-circular include lists

    #ifndef DELETEME_H // if the macro (header file) is not defined. These need to be statistically unique (EX: ECE3220_BAZ_H)
    #define DELETEME_H // define it


    // code declarations go here

    #endif

    - Names that start with _ or __ always indicate system header files and are not for consumer use. Only for system libraries and the kernel.

- Translation Unit
    . Your code, any code that you pull in from the preprocess translation header.
    . Cannot include definitions more than one time in a translation unit.
