Notes October 30:

Polymorphism:
A -> B -> C
ai  bi  ci

A *pa = &bi // this pointer can hold any of these objects (object heirarchy). Can hold as long as the types are derived
- However using this pointer you can only get access to the chunks of the object that are relevant to class A.

LATE BINDING: (The most important aspect of Polymorphism)
- Only occurs to classes that are considered virtual
