- Static duration variables exist before main, and very breifly after main exits
- Static changes a variable to persist through the lifetime of the program
- Static allocates storage for variables before the function main has been called.

Allocator Class Concept:

Once has new (not the allocator)
new -> 1) allocates storage 2) initialize constructor

Can break these concepts up with an allocator^
