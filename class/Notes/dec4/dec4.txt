FINAL EXAM:

THE FINAL IS WEDNESDAY FROM 12:30-2:30

- Static and late binding (virtual (Destructor) ) 		REALLY NEED TO REVIEW HE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS
- Access specifiers ( look up friend declarations )
	. Understand how these affect inheritance
	. 
- Scope and Scope Resolution
- Storage Class Specifiers and Linkage
	. static variables persist through program loaded and unloaded in memory
		. instantiated in the .bss segment
	. local variables
		. in data segment, do not persist
	. global variables
		. default to external linkage
		. extern "C" turns off name mangling in order to link c module into c++ module
	. Heap
		. Any data in the unused (blank portion of the ram)
		. Used for dynamic memory allocation
	. Threads
		. Go into existence when thread is spawned
		. Pops out of existence when thread is "destroyed"?
		. Each thread has own distince copy of variable
- Make script for lecture/ lab



NOTE:
- Don't worry about method pointers for final
	. Know other types of pointers tough
- Atomic class??
	. Part of the lab practical
	. Something about signaling
- MUTEX
	. Talked about in lab. For multiple threads sharing a same object.
	. Important for preventing simultaneous use of an object, protects from data inconsistency.
	.
